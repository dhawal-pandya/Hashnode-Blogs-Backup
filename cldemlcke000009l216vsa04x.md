# What is Strict Mode in React?

Rigidity provides stability, but also gives a bulwark to fight against and rebel, when it gets too rigid. Its importance is only understood in the wild nature, where some predictability is the only thing keeping you alive.

Anyway, `Strict mode` is a feature in React that helps you write more secure and high-quality code by identifying 'potential' problems in your code. When strict mode is enabled, React will run additional checks and warnings for certain components and methods, which can help you catch potential bugs and performance issues early on in the development process.

Strict mode can be enabled by wrapping a component or a section of your code with the `React.StrictMode` component. This component doesn't render any visible content, but it enables strict mode for all the components within it.

Here's an example of how to enable strict mode for a component in React:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const namingIsHard = () => { 
    return ( 
        <React.StrictMode> 
            <div> 
                <h1>My Component</h1> 
                <p>This component is running in strict mode.</p>
            </div> 
        </React.StrictMode> 
    );
}
```

When you run this component in a browser, React will log a warning message in the console for any components that are running in strict mode and have potential problems.

For example, if you use a component that has unsafe lifecycle methods, React will warn you that it is deprecated and that you should use the new lifecycle methods instead.

Remember that strict mode is intended for development only and it should not be used in production. Otherwise it can also slow down your app performance, so it is recommended to remove it before deploying your app.

So basically, strict mode is a feature in React that helps you write more secure and high-quality code by identifying potential problems in your code. It can be enabled by wrapping a component or a section of your code with the `React.StrictMode` component and is intended for development only, it should not be used in production.
