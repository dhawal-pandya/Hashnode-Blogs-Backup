# Understanding Algorithms

Algorithms are a set of instructions or procedures to accomplish a specific task. That is the most basic definition of 'algorithms'. But what do they mean, really?

They are used in computer programming, mathematics, cryptography, and many other fields. The word algorithm is derived from the Arabic word “al-Khwarizmi”, the name of a Persian mathematician who wrote about algorithms in the 9th century.

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, a recipe, or a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer, a human, or any other device.

An algorithm can be considered a mathematical formula that defines the steps required to solve a problem. It starts with an input, performs a set of operations on the input, and returns an output. The output can then be used as an input to another algorithm or as the final result. This is chaining algorithms.

An algorithm can be expressed in different ways, such as using flowcharts, pseudocode, or programming languages. Regardless of the representation, an algorithm must be precise, complete, and unambiguous. In other words, it must clearly define the steps required to solve the problem, and there should not be any ambiguity in the steps.

### Why Algorithms?

Algorithms can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including sorting, searching, optimization, and cryptography.

For example,

* The sorting algorithm is used to rearrange a set of items in a specific order, such as alphabetical order or numerical order.
    
* The searching algorithm is used to find a specific item in a collection of items, such as searching for a specific record in a database.
    
* The optimization algorithm is used to find the best solution to a problem, such as finding the shortest path between two points.
    
* The cryptography algorithm is used to secure communication and protect sensitive information, such as encrypting and decrypting messages.
    

If you look closely, you can find them everywhere around you.

One of the most important aspects of algorithms is their efficiency. The efficiency of an algorithm refers to the amount of time and space it requires to solve a problem. There are two types of efficiency: time efficiency and space efficiency. Time efficiency refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to solve a problem, and space efficiency refers to the amount of memory or storage an algorithm requires to solve a problem.

### How many?

There are different types of algorithms, including sequential algorithms, parallel algorithms, and distributed algorithms.

* Sequential algorithms are algorithms that execute one step at a time, and each step depends on the previous step.
    
* Parallel algorithms are algorithms that can execute multiple steps simultaneously, and each step can be executed independently of the others.
    
* Distributed algorithms are algorithms that are executed on multiple computers or devices, and each device can contribute to solving the problem.
    

Algorithms can also be classified as deterministic algorithms or non-deterministic algorithms.

* Deterministic algorithms are algorithms that always produce the same output for a given input.
    
* Non-deterministic algorithms are algorithms that can produce different outputs for a given input, dependent on global state or external data.
    

### Use to irrelevance

The development of algorithms has had a significant impact on society. Algorithms are used in many everyday applications, such as online shopping, social media, and navigation systems. They are also used in scientific and engineering applications, such as simulations, data analysis, and control systems.

In recent years, the use of algorithms has become a source of concern, as they can have unintended consequences. For example, algorithms can perpetuate biases, such as discrimination and unequal treatment. Algorithms can also amplify the spread of misinformation, such as fake news and conspiracy theories. To address these concerns, there is a growing need for algorithmic transparency, accountability, and fairness. Algorithmic transparency refers to the ability to understand how an algorithm works and what it is doing. Algorithmic accountability refers to the responsibility of those who develop and use algorithms to ensure that they are used in a responsible and ethical manner. Algorithmic fairness refers to the idea that algorithms should not discriminate against certain groups of people or perpetuate existing inequalities.

As algorithms are very efficient, they even perpetuate biases, opacity, and falsehoods very efficiently. We need constant vigil over what we use the algorithms for, as it is just a tool without an intention of its own.

Not caring enough can result in algorithms that reflect and perpetuate existing biases and inequalities. By promoting diversity and inclusivity in the field, we can help ensure that algorithms are designed to benefit everyone, not just a select few.

To achieve algorithmic transparency, accountability, and fairness, organizations and governments are developing new policies, regulations, and standards. For example, the European Union has introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives individuals the right to know how their personal data is being used and processed by algorithms.

### Why learn?

It is important for individuals to educate themselves on algorithms and how they are used in their daily lives. This includes understanding how algorithms can impact their privacy, security, and well-being. It also involves being aware of potential biases and inaccuracies that may be present in algorithms and how they can affect decision-making.

Algorithms play a crucial role in many aspects of our lives and their use is only going to increase in the future. It is therefore important for individuals, organizations, and governments to be proactive in ensuring that algorithms are transparent, accountable, fair, and ethical. By doing so, we can help ensure that algorithms are used for the benefit of society and not to its detriment.

Because algorithms are an essential tool for solving a wide range of problems and have had a profound impact on society, their use also raises important ethical and social questions, and there is a growing need for transparency, accountability, and fairness in the development and use of algorithms.

### Conclusion

As technology continues to advance, it will be important to ensure that algorithms are used in a responsible and ethical manner that benefits society as a whole.

Some say the future AI, nothing but an amalgamation of multiple algorithms, won't be so ethically empty as us.
