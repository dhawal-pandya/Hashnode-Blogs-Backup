# Why is React called 'React'?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, that was developed by Facebook. It was originally released in 2013 and has since become one of the most popular libraries for building web applications.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook, and the name "React" was chosen because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or "reactive." The library was designed to "react" to changes in data.

When data in a React application changes, the components that depend on that data are automatically updated, which allows for efficient and seamless updates to the user interface. The name "React" reflects this reactive nature of the library.

The idea behind React is to build reusable components that can be rendered on the front-end, rather than writing a new piece of code every time you need to display something on the screen. This makes it easier and more efficient to build complex user interfaces.

React is designed to be easy to use and learn, and it is widely popular among developers because of its performance and flexibility.
