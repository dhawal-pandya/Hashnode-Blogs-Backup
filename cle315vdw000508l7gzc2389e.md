### Introduction

As someone constantly on the lookout for the latest and greatest in technology, I'm always on the hunt for new and innovative ways to stay informed. And I've finally found a great piece of technology. Allow me to introduce you to something well worth your attention - Devbytes.

Being notoriously curious about things I love, I am always ravenous about new tech insights. I find myself constantly needing code snippets for basic tasks, explainers for less-used features of a programming language, and new things to talk about. DevBytes comes to my rescue.

### Let me explain what I mean

* My attention span barely outcompetes a goldfish. Devbytes feels like a personal friend looking out for me when it delivers the soul of the content in just 64 words. Crisp, concise, and leaves me just curious enough to read the whole article that explains the content further.
    
* You can also choose the field that interests you the most. There is always overlap between such tightly interconnected technologies, but it tries its best to only deliver what pleases you. Mind you, some serendipity must always be welcome, which is done beautifully by DevBytes. You can have "Big-Tech, Not-So-Big-Tech, or All-Tech" news as you prefer.
    
* Understanding the true needs of a developer, shunning immense theory, and diving straight into code with its code snippets, that explain more than any amount of words could, which you can directly copy and paste into your workflow to see results, is also a breath of fresh air.
    
* Watching the plummet of cryptocurrencies, for its eventual rise forever fascinates me. Devbytes has a tool just for that called "Crypto-Watch", which lists all the famous, and some non-famous crypto-currencies out there, to gauge the current market and make informed decisions. It is just smart to have that in the back of your mind.
    

Now, I must confess when I opened the app for the first time, it had me choose between some characters I knew nothing about. That part bugged me, as it would translate to a different experience based on my choice. But I finally settled on Gilfoyle, which was the correct choice for me anyway. It also made me add a bunch of great shows to my watchlist.

There are also a bunch of features you must explore and discover yourself, like how r/programmerhumor makes its way into your feed or how the "Digest" feature makes sure you don't waste your time unknowingly at least and gives you the summary of the day.

### Final thoughts

Every person who styles themselves as a developer must have this app handy. It is unequivocally far more rewarding than endlessly scrolling through Tumblr or Reddit.

On a more personal note, I wouldn't be talking about it unless I believed in it. The cool Web 3.0 aesthetic aside, what attracted me the most was the fact that this was a democratic endeavor. It is written by developers, for developers. It exactly understands the programmer mindset. All content on the app is always written in concise, laconic words so that it does something that every software developer can appreciate without scruples. It saves you time.
