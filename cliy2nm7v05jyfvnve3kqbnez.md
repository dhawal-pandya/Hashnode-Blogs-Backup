Go is Golang, btw.

So in Go, zero values are the default values assigned to variables of a particular type when they are declared but not explicitly initialized.

### The concept

The concept of zero values is important in Go because it ensures that variables always have a valid value, even if they haven't been explicitly assigned one.

Zero values in Go are determined by the type of the variable. Here are some examples of zero values for different types in Go:

* For numeric types (such as integers and floats), the zero value is 0.
    
* For boolean types, the zero value is false.
    
* For string types, the zero value is an empty string ("").
    
* For complex types (complex64 and complex128), the zero value is 0 + 0i.
    
* For pointer types, the zero value is nil.
    
* For reference types (slices, maps, and channels), the zero value is also nil.
    

### Why tho?

The main purpose of zero values is to provide a safe and predictable default state for variables. When you declare a variable but don't explicitly assign a value to it, Go automatically assigns the zero value of its type. This ensures that the variable is initialized and can be used without causing unexpected behavior or crashes.

By having zero values, Go avoids the problem of uninitialized variables that can exist in other programming languages. In some languages, uninitialized variables can hold arbitrary or garbage values, leading to unpredictable results. In Go, on the other hand, uninitialized variables are automatically assigned zero values, eliminating this source of bugs.

Zero values also make it easier to reason about the behavior of Go programs. Since you can rely on variables having a well-defined default value, you don't have to worry about unexpected states or side effects caused by uninitialized variables.

### What about Null?

Nothing.

Zero values should not be confused with the concept of "null" in some other programming languages. Zero values are valid values for their respective types, whereas null typically represents the absence of a value or a non-existent reference.

### Nil?

In Go, the concept of "null" doesn't exist in the same way as in some other programming languages. Instead, Go uses the concept of "nil" to represent the absence of a value or a non-existent reference.

In Go, nil is a predeclared identifier that represents a zero value for pointers, slices, maps, channels, functions, and interfaces. It is essentially a placeholder that indicates the lack of an actual value. Here's how nil is handled for different types in Go:

* Pointers: If a pointer variable is not explicitly assigned a value, it is automatically assigned the nil value. Nil pointers do not point to any memory address, indicating that they are not referencing any valid object.
    
* Slices, Maps, and Channels: If these reference types are declared but not initialized, they are assigned the nil value. Nil slices, maps, and channels are not associated with any underlying data structure and are considered empty or uninitialized.
    
* Functions: Function variables can also be assigned nil. A nil function variable cannot be invoked and will result in a runtime panic if attempted.
    
* Interfaces: If an interface value is not explicitly assigned a value, it is automatically assigned the nil value. A nil interface does not point to any concrete value or type and represents an empty interface.
    

### Why tho?

It's important to note that Go's approach with nil is different from "null" in languages like Java or C#. In those languages, "null" typically represents a lack of reference to an object, and it can be assigned to any reference type. In Go, nil is primarily used with pointers, slices, maps, channels, functions, and interfaces.

When working with nil values in Go, it's important to handle them appropriately to avoid runtime errors. For example, if you try to dereference a nil pointer or access elements of a nil slice or map, it will result in a runtime panic. Therefore, it's common to check for nil values before operating on them to ensure the code handles such cases gracefully.

### Conclusion

Go uses nil to represent the absence of a value or a non-existent reference for specific types. It is different from "null" in other languages and is primarily associated with pointers, slices, maps, channels, functions, and interfaces.

Proper handling of nil values is necessary to avoid runtime errors.
